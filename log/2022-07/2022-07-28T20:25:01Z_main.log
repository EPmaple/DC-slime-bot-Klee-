2022-07-29T00:23:53Z [chat] traffyboi: if ur diligent, you can convert stam to both xtals and onyx
2022-07-29T00:23:56Z [chat] Ophianne: Stamina gives xtals
2022-07-29T00:23:58Z [chat] Ophianne: And onyx
2022-07-29T00:24:08Z [chat] Ophianne: Yea thattt
2022-07-29T00:24:09Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): how do u convert stamina to crystals?
2022-07-29T00:24:17Z [chat] Ioni: by farming lvl 2
2022-07-29T00:24:18Z [chat] Kenshin: Hot time level 2*

2022-07-29T00:24:22Z [chat] Ophianne: Lvl fodder 2*
2022-07-29T00:25:04Z [chat] Vent (Aile): if you want to really optimize it, its 50 stam for 80 crystals
2022-07-29T00:25:05Z [chat] Ophianne: How i farmed up 72k xtals since i came back at the previous event to before raid start
2022-07-29T00:25:17Z [chat] Ophianne: Only to blow it all and get shit rolls
2022-07-29T00:25:24Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): lmao
2022-07-29T00:25:34Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): where's the best conversion of stamina to 2 star childs?
2022-07-29T00:25:43Z [chat] Vent (Aile): but I settle for the 75 stam for 80 crystals since I want option mats
2022-07-29T00:26:05Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): i feel that it doesn't take that much stamina to get 2 star childs, problem is i always am capped near 700 childs so can't use stamina much
2022-07-29T00:26:19Z [chat] Vent (Aile): whats taking up so much space? 4*?
2022-07-29T00:26:31Z [chat] Ophianne: Turn them to onyx, u can always get more 2* ayeeeee
2022-07-29T00:26:47Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): hmmmm isn't it better to only convert to onyx after level 20?
2022-07-29T00:26:58Z [chat] Ophianne: Yea

2022-07-29T00:27:04Z [chat] Vent (Aile): thing is with 2star is that you consume more 2stars than you gain once you get rolling
2022-07-29T00:27:29Z [chat] Ophianne: Whatchu mean
2022-07-29T00:27:38Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): i dunno i been rolling for a while, and am always full of 2 stars
2022-07-29T00:28:12Z [chat] Apeks: full
2022-07-29T00:28:12Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): i must be doin something wrong
2022-07-29T00:28:17Z [chat] Vent (Aile): thats why I asked whats taking up so much room
2022-07-29T00:28:30Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): let me check...
2022-07-29T00:28:35Z [chat] Vent (Aile): 2star I'm guessing takes up 100-150 slots
2022-07-29T00:28:45Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): is there a "counter" that tells you how many childs u have of what stars
2022-07-29T00:28:53Z [chat] Tachii: only need around 150 by the time hottime ends
2022-07-29T00:29:00Z [chat] Tachii: any more and u can just level that up in story mode
2022-07-29T00:29:12Z [chat] Tachii: would be a qol if they do have that counter
2022-07-29T00:29:27Z [chat] Vent (Aile): I typically just go to the extract page and put everything in of a given type
2022-07-29T00:29:41Z [chat] Ophianne: For me i know i have a lot of 4* and i keep one of every child
2022-07-29T00:29:44Z [chat] Vent (Aile): 5* fodder is easy to check you can go to hor page
2022-07-29T00:29:57Z [chat] Ophianne: So i reach cap real easily
2022-07-29T00:30:00Z [chat] Ioni: 3* evo material also exist
2022-07-29T00:30:07Z [chat] Ophianne: Also i tend to hoard the exp mats
2022-07-29T00:30:21Z [chat] Tachii: i dont keep the 3* slimes
2022-07-29T00:30:36Z [chat] Ioni: maybe that's why you have less space
2022-07-29T00:30:36Z [chat] Tachii: just level up a 4* if u need to get rid of it
2022-07-29T00:33:05Z [chat] Ophianne: Honestly I'm surprised they havent increased the cap ever since i left
2022-07-29T00:33:27Z [chat] Ophianne: Lowkey expected it to hit at least 900 by now
2022-07-29T00:35:00Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): i have none of 1star, 233 of the 2 stars, 20 of the 3 stars, 36 of 4 stars, and 367 of 5 star
2022-07-29T00:35:16Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): what would be the best thing for me to do to manage my units?
2022-07-29T00:35:46Z [chat] Vent (Aile): whats the situation with the 5*
2022-07-29T00:35:55Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): what situation?
2022-07-29T00:36:05Z [chat] Vent (Aile): how many of them are fodder 5*
2022-07-29T00:36:15Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): like how many are at level 1?
2022-07-29T00:36:21Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): how do u check
2022-07-29T00:36:29Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): ez
2022-07-29T00:37:25Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): should i just uncap every single 5 star unit?
2022-07-29T00:37:30Z [chat] Ophianne: 367 5*
2022-07-29T00:37:32Z [chat] Ophianne: Wtf
2022-07-29T00:37:37Z [chat] Vent (Aile): fodder as in which ones you'll use for hor/making cores
2022-07-29T00:38:20Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): i dont know how to answer that question
2022-07-29T00:38:48Z [chat] Ophianne: Basically how many of them are useless
2022-07-29T00:39:21Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): maybe 200
2022-07-29T00:39:48Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): but i can uncap those units in case they come up as ragnaburst boosters?
2022-07-29T00:39:54Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): so keep them on the side?
2022-07-29T00:40:01Z [chat] Ophianne: Yeaaaa use them for making cores or throw them into hor when its hor event i guess
2022-07-29T00:40:12Z [chat] Ophianne: I mean u can just uncap them now if u really want to
2022-07-29T00:40:21Z [chat] Vent (Aile): that'd make them not fodder lol
2022-07-29T00:40:22Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): maybe just uncap everyone
2022-07-29T00:40:49Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): like i have 3 of the 1 star mysterious saturn, i dont think she's used for anything but i should probably just uncap her rite
2022-07-29T00:40:53Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): and rinse and repeat for everyone
2022-07-29T00:41:00Z [chat] Vent (Aile): if you can afford it

2022-07-29T00:53:49Z [chat] Kenshin: it's updated as of this event, and a good starting point to be able to tell
2022-07-29T00:54:53Z [chat] Kenshin: basically, B grade you can keep 1 copy. fodder the rest. C just fodder no copy needed
2022-07-29T00:55:13Z [chat] Kenshin: B+ or higher, collect uncaps
2022-07-29T00:55:27Z [chat] Kenshin: dont raise to 6* unless u need it since it's expensive
2022-07-29T00:56:30Z [chat] Umbrella (GoldHunter): wow, thats amazing, ty!!
2022-07-29T00:56:46Z [chat] Kenshin: you can rely on this too
2022-07-29T00:57:39Z [chat] Kenshin: if it says "reskill soon", keep copies until the reskill happens
2022-07-29T00:58:34Z [chat] traffyboi: im probably gonna be using this for some 5* HoR if any of those units coming out end up being must-haves

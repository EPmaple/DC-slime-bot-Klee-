2022-07-31T03:44:47Z [chat] traffyboi: i think it allowed you to decompose higher ranked gems into lower ranked ones, and it did it at a rate that got you more lower ranked gems than it took to combine and make the same higher ranked gem
2022-07-31T03:45:08Z [chat] traffyboi: hopefully someone will correct me if im wrong, i never did it, so don't remember for sure

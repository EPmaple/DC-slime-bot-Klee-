2022-07-30T13:49:16Z [chat] Kenshin: Nah. We discussed this yesterday briefly
2022-07-30T13:49:35Z [chat] Kenshin: Keeping track of that will inevitably lead to ‘how many’
2022-07-30T13:49:45Z [chat] Kenshin: And then it goes down a slippery slop from there
2022-07-30T13:49:55Z [chat] Tachii: will i mean

2022-07-30T13:51:10Z [chat] Tachii: ?
2022-07-30T13:51:37Z [chat] Kenshin: Leafa’s zoom - he got in first, did not ping, and zoomed. If he got a 2nd one inwojld have propsed time him out
2022-07-30T13:51:42Z [chat] Kenshin: Each situation is diff

2022-07-30T13:53:00Z [chat] Tachii: absolutely should be frowned upon and bullied on
2022-07-30T13:53:02Z [chat] Kenshin: I didnt say the 10 does not get time out
2022-07-30T13:53:20Z [chat] Kenshin: Just that if we establish number the 2 COULD complain
2022-07-30T13:53:25Z [chat] Kenshin: Using the 10
2022-07-30T13:53:41Z [chat] Kenshin: It makes things more complicated

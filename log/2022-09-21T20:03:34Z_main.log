2022-09-21T20:07:17Z [chat] traffyboi: in the future bulba, don't ping yours until someone is in it when we have another one up
2022-09-21T20:07:21Z [chat] Vent (Aile): can we kill apeks yet
2022-09-21T20:07:22Z [chat] traffyboi: zooming apeks
2022-09-21T20:07:35Z [chat] Dostic: apeks dead at 15
2022-09-21T20:07:43Z [chat] feindishly2 (Bulbasaur): oh, I thought it best to ping ASAP
2022-09-21T20:07:56Z [chat] Kenshin: Normally it is
2022-09-21T20:08:15Z [chat] traffyboi: when we have another one up we want to defer the ping as long as possible, to give the most people possible the chance to enter the first one pinged
2022-09-21T20:08:49Z [chat] traffyboi: you might still have a lot of randos that'll zoom that you haven't purged yet though, so it might've been for the best in this case tbh
2022-09-21T20:08:59Z [chat] Kenshin: Once 2nd one is pinged the first kne gets yeeted so fast u can finish spelling yeet

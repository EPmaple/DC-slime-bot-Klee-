2022-09-23T21:05:55Z [chat] Klee: Woah! It is a slime!  (ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ  Klee has counted 15 slimes for Bulbasaur!
2022-09-23T21:11:34Z [chat] feindishly2 (Bulbasaur): awww nuts, missed my own slime
2022-09-23T21:11:41Z [chat] feindishly2 (Bulbasaur): it's dead
2022-09-23T21:12:19Z [chat] feindishly2 (Bulbasaur): if you even need to summon a slime, go grab a "quick cup of coffee"...
2022-09-23T21:12:20Z [chat] Vent (Aile): slime always comes up when you leave your game alone for a few min
2022-09-23T21:12:50Z [chat] Vent (Aile): at keast once a raid I'll go to the bathroom and I'll summon a slime
2022-09-23T21:12:54Z [chat] feindishly2 (Bulbasaur): I also find starting an endless battle reliably enables others to summon slimes. it's uncanny.

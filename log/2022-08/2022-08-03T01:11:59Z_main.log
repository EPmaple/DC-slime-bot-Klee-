2022-08-03T01:24:49Z [chat] Tachii: they have to differentiate themselves

2022-08-03T01:26:02Z [chat] Link2D3atH: they do tend to send invites to ppl fully gear and ignited units
2022-08-03T01:26:17Z [chat] Link2D3atH: cuz they know those acc are active
2022-08-03T01:26:33Z [chat] Tachii: nah 60 is likely our limit for the forseeable future, since some people are in other groups
2022-08-03T01:26:56Z [chat] || eph || booyah ||: <:frogethis:691642111858311259>
2022-08-03T01:27:09Z [chat] || eph || booyah ||: other groups, friends,etc
2022-08-03T01:27:11Z [chat] Vent (Aile): main thing would be getting more active members among our 60

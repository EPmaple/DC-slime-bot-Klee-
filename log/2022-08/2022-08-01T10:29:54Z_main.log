2022-08-01T13:03:57Z [chat] Kenshin: The thing that screw me(and probly most ppl) up is that 5 seconds of boss animation after u enter where u cant pause

2022-08-01T13:04:43Z [chat] Kenshin: So even if i forget for a min nothing will happen

2022-08-01T13:08:59Z [chat] Kenshin: But inremember someone did that in the beginning and then their device closed the app and they lost it lol
2022-08-01T13:09:06Z [chat] Kenshin: I don’t know how often that happens
2022-08-01T13:09:21Z [chat] Kenshin: Ded 13/20
2022-08-01T13:11:59Z [chat] Thaelon: my game crashes quite frequently if I switch to other apps.  Could just be my old phone tho
2022-08-01T13:17:39Z [chat] donuts: if you don't wait until the text disappears at the start of the raid, you may get "booted" from it. once you unpause, shows the raid being over and you've done 0 damage. it's happened to me a few times when i switched apps and came back.

2022-08-01T13:19:22Z [chat] Kenshin: X1 manual
2022-08-01T13:19:27Z [chat] Kenshin: Safest i guess
2022-08-01T13:22:39Z [chat] donuts: usually fine if you pause/switch once the timer actually starts

2022-08-02T21:31:28Z Bot is starting up...
2022-08-02T21:31:30Z Bot is ready.
2022-08-02T21:32:56Z [chat] Vent (Aile): just noticed I was still paused in zeros
2022-08-02T21:32:58Z [chat] Tedo: this is on ios. once the slime loads, i exit the app, not hard quit. that way the timer doesn’t begin and the raid technically hasn’t started
2022-08-02T21:34:01Z [chat] Kenshin: Yea i almost never have a problem on my phone. But halfnthe time im on my tablet its a bit more nuiance because my stand covers the bottom half inch of the tablet
2022-08-02T21:34:12Z [chat] Kenshin: Its tough to swipe up to reveal those buttons
2022-08-02T21:35:14Z [chat] Kenshin: I think I’ll start just hitting the on off button
2022-08-02T21:35:18Z [chat] Kenshin: Just turn it off
2022-08-02T21:35:38Z [chat] Kenshin: Im trying <:feelspainman:887929815347367948>
2022-08-02T21:42:15Z [chat] || eph || booyah ||: my only missed pauses have been emu
2022-08-02T21:42:23Z [chat] || eph || booyah ||: too easy to get distracted or miss the click

in case you use BlueStacks and didn't know, eph
2022-08-02T22:01:43Z [chat] traffyboi: (and didn't already see)
2022-08-02T22:02:39Z [chat] Vent (Aile): gives me the idea to set up a macro to press escape 10 seconds after pressing enter raid, since thats the window that I'm interacting with the game
2022-08-02T22:03:54Z [chat] traffyboi: might be able to have it just spam ESC for 3 minutes and then press continue
2022-08-02T22:04:28Z [chat] Vent (Aile): don't need to press continue you can just press escape again to unpause
2022-08-02T22:04:38Z [chat] traffyboi: <:awkward:887933018793201694>
2022-08-02T22:04:47Z [chat] Vent (Aile): 👀
2022-08-02T22:04:59Z [chat] Vent (Aile): another new thing?
2022-08-02T22:05:00Z [chat] Vent (Aile): lol
2022-08-02T22:05:11Z [chat] traffyboi: <:upsidedownfrogesip:716424665085771786>
2022-08-02T22:05:22Z [chat] traffyboi: I will neither confirm nor deny
2022-08-02T22:05:53Z [chat] Vent (Aile): having it spam escape for 3 min tho might just delay the game long enough and need no interaction before killing it in a timely manner
2022-08-02T22:05:58Z [chat] traffyboi: lol
2022-08-02T22:06:21Z [chat] traffyboi: I didn't know ESC unpaused too
2022-08-02T22:06:31Z [chat] traffyboi: I thought I'd tried that, but definitely not confident
2022-08-02T22:06:47Z [chat] traffyboi: so spamming probably not the best option then
2022-08-02T22:10:15Z [chat] Vent (Aile): true can just have it press escape once then in macro setting have it repeat actions twice with a 3 minute delay
2022-08-02T22:13:23Z [chat] 𝐴𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑠: <@&887894985398157363> me! 😃

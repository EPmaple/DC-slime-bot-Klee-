2022-08-04T15:11:49Z [chat] Thaelon: wish you the best of luck man I just got it for the first time and I'm still dealing with symptoms almost a month later
2022-08-04T15:13:19Z [chat] G̷̉̕u̷͑̚ǹ̴̕ẗ̴̕ḧ̵̏e̴͆́ṙ̵͝: thank you! you got long term symptoms?
2022-08-04T15:34:06Z [chat] G̷̉̕u̷͑̚ǹ̴̕ẗ̴̕ḧ̵̏e̴͆́ṙ̵͝: <@&887894985398157363> 

I am hereby announcing the next Slime King / Slime Queen!

Since I'm mostly only doing the slime results nowadays, as always big thanks to <@930545751258447903> and ~~Bob~~ Bot the Builders!!<:awkward:887933018793201694> 

Continuing on to the results, we have quite a few "almost" records this season (I will put the highest records in brackets like this):
Over the course of the last 2 weeks there were a total of **684 Slimes** (S20 = 715) summoned with an average of **~11.60 Slimes** (S20 = 11.70) per Person.

The Podium:
3rd place goes to <@509805857425588224> again, with **52 Slimes** summoned, 11 more than last time!
2nd place goes to <@207924668844212225> also again, keeping his second place with **61 Slimes** summoned, 17 more than last time!.
1st place goes to <@120428736637173760> . I can see he is so comfortable with his first place, he already brought a couch and snacks to stay... He summoned a almost new record of **66 Slimes** (S25 (2) = 69)!!

Welcome to all the newcomers this season, I hope you like it here and enjoy your nice slimey gold.<:slimeknife:887947273139519488> 
Thank you all for summoning those Slime mountains and who knows, maybe next time we are able to break some records again. See you next ~~Slime ~~time!!<:yummy:887929818639913011>

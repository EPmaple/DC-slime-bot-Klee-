2022-09-22T08:17:42Z [chat] traffyboi: i do not understand who they appeal to

2022-09-22T08:20:12Z [chat] traffyboi: i suppose if us talking about it causes one of us in this discord to play it, that's a win
2022-09-22T08:20:36Z [chat] traffyboi: or if it causes one of us in this discord to talk about it elsewhere that then causes someone else to play it, that's a win
2022-09-22T08:21:20Z [chat] traffyboi: which then leads me to still wonder, what the appeal is to ppl who do play it
2022-09-22T08:22:48Z [chat] DoujinKAMI: No such thing as bad publicity
